Design thoughts:
- RPG elements, Skyrim, oblivion, Hades
- Focus on main control
- Isometric
- Realtime
- Control one unit
- Adventuring
- General fantasy (DnD)
- Questing
- 2.5D, x,y axis
- Not bullet hell
- Projectiles have speed, not hitscan (extended objective)
- Focus on melee
- Arrow/wasd movement
- Basic attacking
- Not grid based movement, movement bound by objects/walls
- Decide on movement speed
- Mouse facing for attacks, bound by WASD/Arrows for movement
